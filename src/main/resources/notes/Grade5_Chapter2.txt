2. Four Operations – Advanced Operations
Addition & Subtraction of Large Numbers
Arrange numbers in columns and add/subtract from right to left.
Carry over for addition, borrow for subtraction.
Example:
47,382 + 25,716 = 73,098
83,721 - 48,509 = 35,212

Multiplication & Division of Large Numbers
Multiplication: Break numbers using place value and multiply step by step.
Example:
236 × 12
= (236 × 10) + (236 × 2)
= 2,360 + 472
= 2,832

Division: Long division method is used for dividing large numbers.
Example: 5,248 ÷ 4

5 ÷ 4 → Quotient = 1, remainder = 1
Bring down 2 → 12 ÷ 4 = 3
Bring down 4 → 24 ÷ 4 = 6
Bring down 8 → 8 ÷ 4 = 2
Answer: 1,312
