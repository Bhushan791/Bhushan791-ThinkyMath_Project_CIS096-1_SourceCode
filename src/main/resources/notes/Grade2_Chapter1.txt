1️⃣ Chapter 1: Numbers (Up to 99)
🎯 What will we learn?

Understanding place value (Tens and Ones)
Counting from 1 to 99
Comparing numbers using greater than (>), less than (<), and equal to (=)
✨ Place Value:
In 47,

4 is in the tens place (40), and
7 is in the ones place (7).
So, 40 + 7 = 47! 🧮
✨ Counting Practice:
Let’s count from 1 to 99! 🔢
1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣, 4️⃣... all the way to 99! 🎉

✨ Comparing Numbers:

55 > 44 (55 is greater than 44) ➡️
33 < 44 (33 is less than 44) ⬅️
22 = 22 (22 is equal to 22) 🟰
